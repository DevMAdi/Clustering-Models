# Clustering

Unlike in traditional classification & regression models where we have 1 dependent variable & many independent variable

Here all variable are independent & this is type of **unsupervised learning** and involves the grouping of **data** points.
It deals with assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called **clusters**) so that observations in the same **cluster** are similar in some sense.

**Models:**

> K-Means Clustering

> Hierarchical Clustering
